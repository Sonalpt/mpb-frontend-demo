# Maison Plisson Staff

Maison Plisson Staff is a full-stack web application that allows the management of the schedules of employees in a luxury grocery store, so that they can consult them from their smartphones. If a schedule were to be modified, the affected employees would receive a notification email directly. The application also allows for printing of the schedule.
